                    <p className='text-slate-500 text-[16px] md:text-[20px] my-5'><span className='font-bold'>📶 BITCOIN</span>: not many wallets, but they can be very large since the bitcoin exchange rate is very high, and if 10 years ago 1 bitcoin was not worth anything, now it is thousands of dollars!</p>
                    <p className='text-slate-500 text-[16px] md:text-[20px] my-5'><span className='font-bold'>🔹 ETHEREUM</span>: Popular cryptocurrency, it finds more wallets, but they can be small, the advantage of Ethereum blockchain is that it has a very big amount of other coins, and besides ETH we can find other coins, like dogecoin, shiba etc.</p>
                    <p className='text-slate-500 text-[16px] md:text-[20px] my-5'><span className='font-bold'>🪙 LITECOIN</span>: The advantage of this blockchain is low commissions and it is not rare to find good wallets, in general it is an old blockchain and there are a lot of forgotten wallets</p>
                    <p className='text-slate-500 text-[16px] md:text-[20px] my-5'><span className='font-bold'>🔸 BNB</span>: This is a young but popular blockchain, there are many projects on it and we can get cool results using it in searches!</p>
                    <p className='text-slate-500 text-[16px] md:text-[20px] my-5'><span className='font-bold'>🪙 SOLANA</span> : A blockchain with lots of users and lots of forgotten wallets of different sizes. I recommend everyone to buy it!</p>
                    <p className='text-slate-500 text-[16px] md:text-[20px] my-5'><span className='font-bold'>🔴 TRON</span>: This coin is used by most people for online payments and very often they send coins to the wrong place, large wallets are not rare (most of USDT is on TRON blockchain)</p>
                    <p className='text-slate-500 text-[16px] md:text-[20px] my-5'><span className='font-bold'>🪙 RIPPLE</span>: Same as Litecoin, coz it’s also low commissions and a lot of wallets, coz it’s an old blockchain</p>
                    <p className='text-slate-500 text-[16px] md:text-[20px] my-5'><span className='font-bold'>🐶 DOGE</span>: I think everyone knows it! Not so profitable, all wallets usually with low balances, but hits pretty often</p>
                    <p className='text-slate-500 text-[16px] md:text-[20px] my-5'><span className='font-bold'>🪙 TON</span>: Telegram crypto, which is hyping now. It was very interesting to build a software for this crypto. Results are unstable so do not recommend it for the start.</p>

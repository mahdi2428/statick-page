                <p>‚û°Ô∏è I always say that the frequency depends on <b>HOW MANY BLOCKCHAINS YOU USE</b> ‚Äì the more you use, chances to find something are higher.</p>
                <p>Also, the number of devices you use matters. <b>The more, the better </b>. The license is issued for 1 pc, but each additional PC in the license costs only <b>$200</b>, regardless of the number of blockchains in the license.</p>
                <p>üîªLet‚Äôs say, you‚Äôre using one device.</p>
                <p>1 blockchains will give you about 1-2 wallets per week.</p>
                <p>2-5 blockchains will give you about 3-5 wallets per week.</p>
                <p>If you have 6-9 blockchains, you can expect 6-10+ wallets per week.</p>
